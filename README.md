## Project Description:
![Design preview for the Tip calculator app coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

### Objective:

The project aims to create a simple calculator that allows users to quickly calculate the tip amount based on the bill amount and a specified tip percentage.

### Functionality Description:

- **Enter the bill amount:** Users can enter the total bill amount for tip calculation.
- **Specify tip percentage:** Allow the selection of a percentage to be applied for tip calculation.
- **Calculate tip:** The application performs calculations and presents the user with the tip amount and the total amount to be paid (bill + tip).

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Enter the bill amount:** Users can input the bill amount in a text field.
- **Select tip percentage:** Ability to choose the tip percentage from a dropdown list.
- **Display result:** Presentation of the calculated tip amount and the total amount to be paid.

### Non-functional Requirements:

- **Responsiveness:** The application interface should be accessible and user-friendly on different devices.
- **Ease of use:** Intuitive interface, easy for users to navigate.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Interface Visualizations:

- *Bill amount input field*
- *Tip percentage selection field*
- *Calculate button*
- *Display of tip amount and total amount to be paid*

### Site Map:

- *Homepage*: User interface containing fields to input the bill amount and select the tip percentage, along with a button for calculation.

## System Architecture:

### Technologies:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (without the need for frameworks).

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit tests:** Checking the correctness of calculations for different values.
- **Interface tests:** Ensuring that the interface works correctly on various devices and browsers.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (without the need for frameworks).

### Code Structure:

- *Directories/files:* Separate files for application logic, interface, and data management.
- *Coding style:* Use of modules, comments, and understandable variable names.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit tests:** Checking the correctness of individual application functions.
- **User interface tests:** Checking user interaction on different devices and browsers.

### Testing Procedures:

- Development of a set of test cases for each application function.
- Establishment of procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment stages:** Testing, corrections, publication on the production server.
- **Deadlines:** Determining dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical support:** Establishing communication channels with users for issue reporting.
- **Updates:** Planning regular updates based on user feedback and needs.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Implementation stages:** Dividing work into specific tasks (e.g., interface design, function implementation, testing).
- **Deadlines:** Determining the time required for each stage.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application development:** Based on hours of work or a programming team.
- **Maintenance costs:** Servers, external services, potential fees for technical support.
